What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge: Combines changes by creating a new merge commit, preserving the original branch histories. 
Rebase: Integrates changes by rewriting the commit history of the rebased branch, making it appear as if the changes were made directly on top of the target branch. 

What is a remote repository?
Remote repositories provide a way to synchronize code between different team members and serve as a backup of the project.
